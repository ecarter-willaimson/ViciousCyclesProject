            I was living in my parents shed for 30 years until one day in 1998, their house was burned down with them inside the home and got $500,000.

<p>
    I dediced to create my bike shop "Vicious Cycles" in my hometown of Garner after blowing half of the money in Veg- uh I mean watching all of the poor starving children of Garner that don't have any bikes to bike to that fun Ice Cream Truck.

<p>
    Selling bikes is "my dream" and I want to give back to my community by selling the best bikes for much affordable prices than the competition.
